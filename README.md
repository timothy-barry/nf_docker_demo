# nf_docker_demo

A repo containing a simple Nextflow pipeline. There are several ways to run this pipeline:

1. With or without the docker image. To use the Docker image, use the flag '-with-docker timbarry/nf_docker_demo:1.0'. If not using the Docker image, be sure to have the following dependences installed:
- R (>= 4.0.0)
- 'broom'
- 'dplyr'
- 'magrittr'

2. From a cached repo or a cloned repo. To download the pipeline automatically from Github and run the cached version, use
'nextflow run timothy-barry/nf_docker_demo'. Otherwise, 'git clone,' 'cd' into the cloned directory, and run the pipeline via 'nextflow run main.nf'.

For example, to download the repository automatically from Github and run it with docker:
'nextflow run timothy-barry/nf_docker_demo -with-docker timbarry/nf_docker_demo:1.0'.
